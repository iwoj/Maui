Maui is an API for developing event-driven, object-oriented user interfaces. Applications are written in a manner similar to the Java Swing API, and are maintained in memory on the server-side. The HTTP request/response protocol are abstracted away from the application developer, as is all of the client rendering (HTML, Javascript, etc.).

One benefit of this approach, is that Maui will render different outputs for different browsers, handling differences between them gracefully. Maui apps currently deploy to the following platforms:
